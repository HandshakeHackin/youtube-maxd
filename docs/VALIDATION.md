# Offline validation record — 0.1.0

Host: Windows/WSL Ubuntu, LLVM 18.1.8, Python 3.14. Native implementation
revision: `ecacf92` plus the packaged-notices change. This record concerns
offline behavior and packaging, not console or live-service acceptance.

* Companion: 30 automated tests passed. One upstream Starlette TestClient
  deprecation warning remains; no test failed. Tests include authentication,
  pairing expiry/rate limits, stable catalog identities/link browsing, format
  eligibility, session bounds/expiry, range relay, credential scoping across
  redirects, caption timing, asynchronous jobs, cancellation and SponsorBlock.
* Shipping native provider: AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer passed
  with leak checking. Registry isolation, persistence, local favorites/queue/
  follows/history, pairing/jobs, cancellation, origin rejection, chapters and
  transitive SponsorBlock overlaps are checked with mocked native HTTP.
* Real HTTP fixture probe: AVC/AAC DASH, VP9/Opus DASH and finite HLS each
  exposed both audio/video streams, decoded successfully, and passed a host
  seek/decode probe. Timed SRT captions and local PNG thumbnails passed.
  Detailed generated evidence: `output/validation/companion-media.json`.
* Shipping TV RML: host RmlUi/EVO renderer checked eight-card bounds, D-pad
  focus, stable selection, empty/loading/error states. PNG previews were
  inspected. RmlUi emits transient array-binding warnings when fixture rows
  shrink; the rendered states and selection assertions pass.
* PS5 packaging: all 210 native objects compiled; native app converted and
  signed containers inspected with valid integrity. MkPFS packed/verified the
  `.ffpfsc`; folder-title ZIP was generated. Final artifacts/checksums are in
  `dist/`. The app uses `PPSA99142` and independent storage, with original art.

No deployment, console launch, PS5 frame/audio measurement, Google login,
live YouTube extraction or live SponsorBlock call was performed. Follow
HARDWARE_ACCEPTANCE.md before describing the app as hardware-validated.

## PS5 parity integration — 2026-10-09

On the PS5-only branch at `7c63593`, 41 Python tests, 14 Node tests, and the
native provider ASan/UBSan suite with leak checking passed. Library coverage
includes profile isolation, modern cards, bounded continuation and replies;
native mocked HTTP covers profile/feed/playlist navigation. These are offline
checks and do not establish live account behavior or full SmartTube parity.

Candidate `bc3a686` compiled 210 PS5 objects and passed native container and PFS
packaging checks with development controls enabled. Its commands, status and
logs use the application's own data directory. Normal builds keep development
controls disabled. The exact candidate is frozen separately from release output;
console acceptance is recorded in HARDWARE_ACCEPTANCE.md.

## Audio tail completion — 2026-10-09

Revision `0af336d` adds bounded FFmpeg decoder and resampler EOF flushing,
counted padding for the final PCM block, and an epoch-scoped audio drain signal.
The actual generated EVO audio implementation and playback clock were linked
with host FFmpeg 8 and exercised under ASan/UBSan. The cases passed for real AAC
decoder EOF, a 44.1 kHz resampler tail, partial-block padding, output failure,
stale seek epochs, producer parking during seek, and video continuing after the
audio clock stops. Evidence: `.deps/audio-drain-current.log`.

Natural demux EOF is now distinguished from failed input recovery. Known-duration
queue completion additionally requires audio drain. These tests mock AudioOut
and do not prove audible hardware output, video/presentation drain, or completion
of unknown-duration streams. Those remain explicit acceptance and implementation
gaps; the full SmartTube parity goal remains open.
