# Build and offline validation

Use Linux/WSL. Keep the native cache on its Linux filesystem; scripts default
to `$HOME/.cache/prosperotube`. Sources may be on `/mnt/c`.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
sudo apt-get install clang-18 lld-18 llvm-18 cmake ninja-build make git \
  python3 python3-venv pkg-config ccache wget curl unzip zip nasm yasm \
  libssl-dev libfreetype-dev libzstd-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev ffmpeg
export PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-18/bin:$PATH
bash scripts/bootstrap_sdk.sh
bash scripts/build_ps5.sh --ffpfsc
```

LLVM 18.1.8 was used. Package names vary by distribution. The bootstrap fetches
release assets into an isolated user prefix. `PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK` selects an existing
SDK, but the build installs libraries into it; use a dedicated copy.
`PROSPEROTUBE_NATIVE_WORK` selects a dedicated generated work tree.

Pins: EVO `9715f6ee9bf9b53461d6fdf9a2e11b4c48357783`, UI
`4bd942579dd981b3df9c740438489ca6a614ddc0`, SDK v0.42, Pacbrew v0.39,
FFmpeg 7.1.1 minimal, dav1d 1.5.1, cJSON 1.7.19, MkPFS
`6cb8313dfe0c988ac52617794553f343243d3a56`. Upstream build scripts check
source archive checksums. SDK/Pacbrew assets are release-tag pinned, not
independently checksum-pinned by this wrapper.

`prepare_native.py` checks the EVO commit, extracts pinned sources, restores
every overlaid file before applying checked patches, and copies the original
provider/UI and complete cJSON. It never edits the submodule checkout.
`build_ps5.sh` uses EVO's native packaging pipeline, builds software FFmpeg,
signs/inspects containers and copies artifacts to `dist/`. MkPFS verifies its
image. Network access is needed only for uncached dependencies. Scripts never
deploy or launch on PS5.

## Checks

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r companion/requirements.lock
PYTHONPATH=companion .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
bash scripts/test_native.sh
python3 scripts/generate_fixtures.py
PYTHONPATH=companion .venv/bin/python scripts/probe_companion.py
bash scripts/preview_native.sh
```

The native provider runs with AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer and
mocked HTTP. Tests cover isolation, persistence, stable identities, pairing,
jobs/cancellation, origin checks, chapters and SponsorBlock.
The media probe runs the real HTTP API/relay against generated AVC/AAC, VP9/Opus
and HLS, then decodes and seeks with host FFmpeg and checks caption timing.
This tests host FFmpeg, not the PS5 build. The UI preview builds pinned RmlUi 6.2
and renders the shipping interface with EVO's CPU renderer, checking card bounds,
focus and selection. PNGs: `output/preview`; media evidence: `output/validation`.
Fixtures and outputs are generated, not tracked.

## Offline console fixtures

After generating media:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=companion .venv/bin/python -m prosperotube \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --public-base http://YOUR-PC-LAN-IP:8765 \
  --fixtures fixtures/generated
```

Pair and search any term. Three labelled synthetic videos exercise AVC/AAC DASH,
VP9/Opus DASH and finite HLS. Thumbnails/media are local. This mode does not
contact YouTube or SponsorBlock and does not establish service compatibility.
